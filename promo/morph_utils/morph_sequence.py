Given two lists of tuples of the form [(value, time), (value, time)], morph
can iteratively transform the values in one list to the values in the other
while maintaining the times in the first list.

Both time scales are placed on a relative scale.  This assumes that the times
may be different and the number of samples may be different but the 'events'
occur at the same relative location (half way through, at the end, etc.).

Both dynamic time warping and morph, align two data lists in time.  However,
dynamic time warping does this by analyzing the event structure and aligning
events in the two signals as best it can
(i.e. it changes when events happen in relative time while morph preserves
when events happen in relative time).
